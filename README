Chemistry::3DBuilder 0.10
=========================

This module generates a three-dimensional molecular structure from a connection
table, such as that obtained by a 2D representation of the molecule or from a
SMILES string.

NOTE: this module is still at a very early stage of development so it has
important limitations. 1) It doesn't handle rings or stereochemistry yet!  2)
The bond lengths and atoms are very approximate as they don't really account
for different elements. 3) Only the sp3, sp2, and sp hybridizations are
supported.
